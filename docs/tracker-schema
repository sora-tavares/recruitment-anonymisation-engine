# Recruitment Tracker Schema (Phase 1)

This tracker provides an auditable log of each recruitment document received and its progress through the anonymisation workflow.

One row represents **one DOCX file** (CV, cover letter, or other supporting document).

---

## Key fields

### RefID (string)
A reference ID generated at email intake.  
Used to group multiple files from the same email into a single “candidate pack”.

Example format:
- `REC-ddMMyyyy-HHmm`

Notes:
- RefID is not shown to candidates.
- RefID is used internally only for tracking and file association.

---

### DocSeq (integer)
A sequence number to distinguish multiple DOCX files under the same RefID.

Examples:
- RefID `REC-24122025-2000` with two DOCX files → DocSeq 1 and 2.

---

## File metadata

### OriginalFileName (string)
Original attachment filename as received.

### FileType (string: CV | CL | Other)
A filename-based classification to help sorting/filtering.

Heuristics include:
- CV: filename contains `cv` or `resume`
- CL: filename contains `cover`, `letter`, or common abbreviations like `cl`

Important:
- This label is informational only and must not gate anonymisation.
- If unknown, default to `Other`.

### DateReceived (string / datetime)
Timestamp of intake in UK time.

Recommended format:
- `dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm`

### SenderEmail (string/email)
Email address of the sender (from the message metadata).

### Subject (string)
Email subject line at intake.

---

## Processing fields

### Status (string: Incoming | To Anonymise | Done | Archived)
Represents the document lifecycle (not mailbox folder location):

- **Incoming**: row created at intake
- **To Anonymise**: DOCX saved into `Recruitment/1_To_Anonymise`
- **Done**: anonymised file created in `Recruitment/2_Anonymised`
- **Archived**: original file moved from `1_To_Anonymise` to an archive location after success

### Notes (string)
Operational notes to support triage and audit.

Examples:
- `Email contained 2 attachments.`
- `Mixed submission rejected (PDF present).`
- `Auto-classified as CL based on filename.`

Notes should remain non-sensitive and must not include candidate PII beyond what already exists in the SenderEmail field.

---

## Optional future fields (Phase 2+)

These are not required for Phase 1 but are useful once Python is integrated:

- **AnonymisedFileName** (string)
- **ArchivePath** (string)
- **ProcessedDateTime** (datetime)
- **ProcessorVersion** (string) e.g. anonymiser version
- **ErrorFlag** (boolean)
- **ErrorMessage** (string)
